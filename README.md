## Project Overview

<a name="project-overview"></a>

This project focuses on developing a robust credit card fraud detection system using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging a dataset of over 550,000 credit card transactions, we implemented various algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, integrated through a stacking ensemble method to achieve high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions. This work is developed at the University of Camerino by Damiano Pasquini, Nicol Buratti, and Mathukiya Vaibhav Jagdish, for the Research Methodologies 2023/24 course under the supervision of Andrea Morichetta and Romeo Pruno.

### Libraries
To replicate our results, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- pandas (Version 2.2.2)
- numpy (Version 1.26.4)
- scikit-learn (Version 1.5.0)
- matplotlib (Version 3.9.0)
- seaborn (Version 0.13.2)
- jupyter (1.0.0)

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas==2.2.2 numpy==1.26.4 scikit-learn==1.5.0 matplotlib==3.9.0 seaborn==0.13.2 jupyter==1.0.0
```

### Hardware Requirements
To efficiently run the analysis and model training, the following hardware specifications are recommended:
- CPU: Multi-core processor (Quad-core or higher)
- RAM: Minimum 16 GB
- GPU: Optional
