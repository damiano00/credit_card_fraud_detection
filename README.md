# Credit Card Fraud Detection

In this project we aim to develop better models than the current state of the art in credit card fraud detection, using most of the standard machine learning models. This project was created for the Research Methodologies at the University of Camerino (A.Y. 2023/24) by Damiano Pasquini, Nicol Buratti, and Mathukiya Vaibhav Jagdish.
